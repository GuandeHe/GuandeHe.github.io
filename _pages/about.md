I'm a second year master student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and [Prof. Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from the [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2021.

My research interest includes **machine learning** and **uncertainty quantification**, especially focusing on the pre-train & fine-tune paradigm.

Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.
