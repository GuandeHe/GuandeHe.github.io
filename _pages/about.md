I'm a second year master's student at the [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and [Prof. Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/). Before that, I got my bachelor's degree from the [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2021.

My research interest includes **machine learning** and **uncertainty quantification**, especially focusing on foundation models under pre-train & fine-tune paradigm.
