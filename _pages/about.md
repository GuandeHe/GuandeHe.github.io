I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/), [The University of Texas at Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with Prof. [Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Before that, I was a Master's student at the [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), where I was honored to be advised by Prof. [Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and Prof. [Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/). I received my B.Eng. from the [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2021. Currently, I am also a research intern at [Adobe Research](https://research.adobe.com/) under Dr. [Eli Shechtman](https://research.adobe.com/person/eli-shechtman/)'s team.

My research interests include machine learning and foundation models. I am currently developing principled post-training algorithms (e.g., distillation, alignment, and self-play refinement) and efficient sampling techniques for deep generative models.
