I am a first-year Ph.D. student at the [McCombs School of Business](https://www.mccombs.utexas.edu/), [The University of Texas of Austin](https://www.utexas.edu/), working with [Prof. Mingyuan Zhou](https://mingyuanzhou.github.io/). Before that, I was a Master's student at the [TSAIL Group](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/), [Department of Computer Science and Technology, Tsinghua University](https://www.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/csen/), where I was honered to be advised by [Prof. Jun Zhu](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jun/index.shtml) and [Prof. Jianfei Chen](https://ml.cs.tsinghua.edu.cn/~jianfei/). I received my B.Eng. from the [School of Software, Tsinghua University](https://www.thss.tsinghua.edu.cn/en/) in 2021.

My research interest includes machine learning and foundation models. I am currently working on developing principled post-training (e.g., distillation, alignment, and self-play refinement) algorithms and efficient sampling techniques for deep generative models.
